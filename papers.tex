    ``It has long been known'' & I didn't look up the original reference. \\ \hline
    ``A definite trend is evident'' & The data are practically meaningless. \\ \hline
    ``While it has not been possible to provide definite answers to the questions'' & An unsuccessful experiment, but I still hope to get it published. \\ \hline
    ``Three of the samples were chosen for detailed study'' & The other results didn't make any sense. \\ \hline
    ``Typical results are shown'' & This is the prettiest graph. \\ \hline
    ``These results will be in a subsequent report'' & I might get around to this sometime, if published/funded. \\ \hline
    ``A careful analysis of obtained data'' & Three pages of notes were obliterated when I knocked over a glass of beer. \\ \hline
    ``After additional study by my colleagues'' & They didn't understand it, either. \\ \hline
    ``Thanks are due to Joe Blotz for assistance with the experiment and to Cindy Adams for valuable discussions'' & Mr.\ Blotz did the work and Mrs.\ Adams explained to me what it meant. \\ \hline
    ``A highly significant area for exploratory study'' & A totally useless topic selected by my committee. \\ \hline
    ``In my experience'' & Once. \\ \hline
    ``In case after case'' & Twice. \\ \hline
    ``In a series of cases'' & Three times. \\ \hline
    ``It is believed that'' & I think. \\ \hline
    ``It is generally believed that'' & A couple of others think so, too. \\ \hline
    ``Correct within an order of magnitude'' & Wrong. \\ \hline
    ``According to statistical analysis'' & Rumor has it. \\ \hline
    ``It is clear that much additional work will be required before a complete understanding of this phenomenon occurs'' & I don't understand. \\ \hline
    ``A statistically-oriented projection of significance of these findings'' & A wild guess. \\ \hline
    ``It is hoped that this study will stimulate further investigations in this field'' & I quit. \\
